# Sudoku-Solver

This project showcases a Python implementation of the well-known puzzle game, Sudoku. It is comprised of two Python files - one enables the user to input any legitimate Sudoku board and view the answer, while the other lets the user play Sudoku and view the solution if they are unable to solve it independently.
